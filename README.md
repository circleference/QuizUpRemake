# QuizUpRemake
A Scratch 3.0 remake of QuizUp

QuizUp was a multiplayer game where one user competes against another in seven rounds of timed multiple-choice questions of various topics. (copied from Wikipedia)

Due to the game being discontinued, i made a recreation in Scratch.

The problem is that the file is over 5 MB, so i decided to upload it at Github.
