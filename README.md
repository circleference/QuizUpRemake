# QuizUpRemake
A Scratch 3.0 remake of QuizUp

QuizUp was a multiplayer game where one user competes against another in seven rounds of timed multiple-choice questions of various topics. (copied from Wikipedia)

Due to the game being discontinued, i made a recreation in Scratch.

The problem is that the file is over 5 MB, so i decided to upload it at Github.

# How to package

TurboWarp Packager is the packager i use, so i will show you how to compile this project properly.

Go to https://packager.turbowarp.org/ and load the .sb3 file of the game.

After that, download turbowarp-packager-settings.json

Then, scroll down on the packager site and click "Import settings", and select the file you downloaded

It is recommended to follow the steps below for a stable performance:

- Keep Turbo mode off. (required)
- Keep the framerate over 30. (recommended)
- Keep High Quality Pen on. (recommended but not needed)
- Keep size settings to default. (recommended)
- Keep Special cloud features on. (required)
- Keep "Start project automatically instead of showing a big green flag" off (recommended)
- Keep "Enable Compiler" on. (recommended but not needed)
